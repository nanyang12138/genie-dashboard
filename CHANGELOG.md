# aicodeman

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Visual redesign with glass morphism, refined colors, and polished UI. Optimize history endpoint with buffer reuse and line iterator. Fix Ink frame search window (4KB→64KB) to prevent partial frames. Fix stale terminal data on tab switch via chunkedTerminalWrite cancellation. Improve history prompt extraction with expanded command filtering and tail scan fallback. Align case select group height to match dropdown. Fix no-control-regex lint error for ANSI strip pattern. Add browser-testing-guide to CLAUDE.md references.

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- feat: improve session navigability in history and monitor panel (closes #45)
  - History items now show the first user prompt as the title with the project path as a subtitle, making it much easier to distinguish sessions from the same project
  - The `/api/history/sessions` endpoint extracts the first user message from each transcript JSONL, stripping system-injected XML tags and command artifacts, truncating to 120 chars
  - Monitor panel session rows are now clickable — clicking navigates directly to that session's tab via `selectSession()`; Kill button retains independent behavior via `stopPropagation()`
  - Updated CLAUDE.md architecture tables to reflect Orchestrator Loop additions (14 route modules, 15 type files, orchestrator domain files, orchestrator-panel.js frontend module)
  - fix: stop subagent monitor windows from auto-opening on discovery
  - feat: add Orchestrator Loop with phased plan execution, live progress during plan generation, and toolbar button (hidden until fully tested)
  - fix: patch 3 production bugs found during deep audit
  - fix: restore mobile terminal scrollback using JS scrollLines() instead of broken native scroll

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix mobile keyboard scroll and layout issues:
  - Prevent iOS Safari from scrolling the page when typing with the keyboard open (position:fixed on .app + window.scroll reset)
  - Eliminate dead space between terminal and keyboard accessory bar by removing redundant CSS padding, tightening JS padding constant, and adding row quantization gap compensation
  - Fix toolbar overlapping terminal content when keyboard is hidden by adding proper padding-bottom to .main, including iOS Safari bottom bar offset
  - Strip Ink spinner bloat from terminal buffer before tailing
  - Fix resolveCasePath priority order and suppress JSON parse warnings

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix mobile keyboard toolbar positioning on iOS Safari: toolbar (Run/Stop/Run Shell) was hidden behind the accessory bar when virtual keyboard was active due to overlapping CSS positions. Remove the aggressive safety check in `updateLayoutForKeyboard()` that incorrectly dismissed keyboard state when iOS scrolled the visual viewport during typing. Add Safari-bar CSS offset to accessory bar so it properly stacks above the toolbar. Remove the double-counted Safari-bar offset when keyboard is visible since the JS transform already covers the full distance.

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- fix: mobile keyboard hides terminal content on iPhone

  Fixed a bug where opening the virtual keyboard on iPhone left zero visible terminal space. Two independent mechanisms were both accounting for the keyboard height: `MobileDetection.updateAppHeight()` shrunk `--app-height` to the visual viewport height, while `KeyboardHandler.updateLayoutForKeyboard()` added a large `paddingBottom`. These double-counted, leaving negative space for the terminal (user saw accessory bar + toolbar but no terminal content).

  Fix: `updateAppHeight()` now skips when the keyboard is visible, and `handleViewportResize()` restores `--app-height` to the pre-keyboard value on first detection (since MobileDetection's listener fires before KeyboardHandler's). On keyboard close, `--app-height` is re-synced to the current visual viewport.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Refactor case routes: extract readLinkedCases() and resolveCasePath() helpers to eliminate 6x duplicated linked-cases.json path construction and 5x duplicated file read/parse logic. Replace O(n) .some() duplicate check with O(1) Set.has() in case listing. Un-export unused isError() type guard. Standardize reply.status() to reply.code() in system routes. Update CLAUDE.md frontend module listing and SSE event count.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- Extract monolithic app.js (~12.5K lines) into 6 focused domain modules that extend CodemanApp.prototype via Object.assign: terminal-ui.js (terminal setup, rendering pipeline, controls), respawn-ui.js (respawn banner, countdown, presets, run summary), ralph-panel.js (Ralph state panel, fix_plan, plan versioning), settings-ui.js (app settings, visibility, web push, tunnel/QR, help), panels-ui.js (subagent panel, teams, insights, file browser, log viewer), session-ui.js (quick start, session options, case settings). Fix critical deferred script init ordering bug: wrap CodemanApp instantiation in DOMContentLoaded so all defer'd mixin modules execute their Object.assign before the constructor runs. Guard missing cleanupWizardDragging() call in subagent-windows.js. Update build.mjs to minify/hash all new modules.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Performance optimizations: V8 compile cache for 10-20% faster cold starts, lazy-load WebGL addon (244KB saved on mobile), preload hints for critical scripts, batch tmux reconciliation (N subprocess calls → 1). Also: WebSocket session lifecycle fixes, CJK IME input support, CI upgrade to Node 24/actions v6, install.sh fork support, and CLAUDE.md/README documentation refresh.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add CJK IME input textarea for xterm.js terminal (env toggle INPUT_CJK_FORM=ON). Always-visible textarea below terminal handles native browser IME composition, forwarding completed text to PTY on Enter. Supports arrow keys, Ctrl combos, backspace passthrough, and Escape to clear.

  Add fork installation support to install.sh with CODEMAN_REPO_URL and CODEMAN_BRANCH env vars, allowing custom repository and branch for git clone/update operations. README updated with fork installation instructions.

  Fix WebSocket session lifecycle: close WS connections when session exits (prevents orphaned listeners and stale writes to dead PTY), add readyState guard in onTerminal to stop buffering after socket closes, simplify heartbeat by removing redundant alive flag.

  Add WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff (1s-10s) on unexpected close, skipping server rejection codes (4004/4008/4009). Falls back gracefully to SSE+POST during reconnection.

  Clear CJK textarea on session switch to prevent sending stale text to wrong session.

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- Add WebSocket terminal I/O with server-side DEC 2026 synchronized update markers. Replaces per-keystroke HTTP POST + SSE terminal output with a single bidirectional WebSocket connection for dramatically lower input latency. Server-side 8ms micro-batching with 16KB flush threshold groups rapid PTY events into single WS frames wrapped in DEC 2026 markers for flicker-free atomic rendering. Includes 30s ping/pong heartbeat with 10s timeout for stale connection detection through tunnels. Existing SSE + HTTP POST paths remain fully functional as transparent fallback. Resize messages validated to match HTTP route bounds (cols 1-500, rows 1-200, integers only). 16 automated route tests added for WS endpoint. Also patches 5 dependency vulnerabilities (basic-ftp, fastify, minimatch, serialize-javascript).

  - refactor: extract shared \_fetchHistorySessions() method to eliminate duplication
  - refactor: remove dead DEC 2026 sync code (extractSyncSegments, DEC_SYNC_START/END constants)

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- Add content-hash cache busting for static assets — build step now renames JS/CSS files with MD5 content hashes (e.g. app.js → app.94b71235.js) and rewrites index.html references. HTML served with Cache-Control: no-cache so browsers always revalidate and pick up new hashed filenames after deploys. Hashed assets keep immutable 1-year cache. Eliminates the need for manual hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) after deployments.

  Refactor path traversal validation into shared validatePathWithinBase() helper in route-helpers.ts, replacing 6 duplicate inline checks across case-routes, plan-routes, and session-routes.

  Deduplicate stripAnsi in bash-tool-parser.ts — use shared utility from utils/index.ts instead of private method.

## 0.3.8

### Patch Changes

- Add tunnel status indicator with control panel — green pulsing dot in header when Cloudflare tunnel is active, dropdown with URL, remote clients, auth sessions, and start/stop/QR/revoke controls

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes
